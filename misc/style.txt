Style notes for spncci project

----------------------------------------------------------------

Coding generally follows the Google C++ style guidelines:

  https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

Indenting follows emacs C++ mode "gnu" mode conventions.  To disable
tabs in emacs, the following code may be included in your emacs
init.el file:

  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

For more information, see:

  https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/IndentingC

----------------------------------------------------------------

Namespaces

  Avoid using "using" declarations.

  Even though namespace qualifiers are not strictly needed when you
  are accessing an identifier from the same namespace, go ahead and
  consistently use namespace qualifiers anyway, for readability, and
  so that the code can easily be adapted for use outside of the
  namespace.

Half-integer values

  Use the HalfInt type, rather than explicitly storing twice the
  value in an integer variable, as many physics codes do.

  Convert HalfInt back to int/double as needed using the int() or
  double() conversions, rather than the other more verbose accessors
  (which were defined pre-C++11).  You might also use the
  TwiceValue(h) function if you actually need the integer equal to
  twice the HalfInt's value.

  When a half-integer variable is stored to file, do go ahead and
  store it as an integer equal to twice the value.  If this
  input/output value must be temporarily stored in an integer
  variable, use a name of the form "twice_x".

Text input

  Use the mcutils/parsing functions for uniform error messages.

Class declarations

  Note on use of "inline" keyword: Some member functions defined in
  class declarations start with a superfluous "inline" keyword.  This
  is purely as a workaround for a bug in the emacs C++ mode
  indentation, which causes incorrect indentation when a constructor
  initializer is present.

  We use a Str() member function (a la Python) to generate a simple
  text representation of an object (e.g., a group label), as might be
  used in production output.

  We use a LabelStr() member function to generate a string
  representation of some label describing the contents of the object,
  e.g., the quantum numbers for a subspace object.

  We use a DebugStr() member function to generate a full data dump of
  an object, as might be used in debugging and testing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Note on uppercase mathematical symbols
2/17/17 (mac)

There is a conflict between mathematical notation, e.g.,

     int twice_Nsigma0;

and strict google lowercase convention, e.g.,

     int twice_nsigma0;

Mathematical understandability takes precedence here...  You can't 
change the case of a mathematical variable, as that changes the meaning.  

We are not consistent about this when the letters form part of a
coupling scheme name, e.g., "lsjt_scheme" or "u3st_scheme".  Here one
may think of "lsjt" more as an identifier (name) than as a
mathematical expression.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The #define guard
2/19/17 (mac)

Google style: All header files should have #define guards to prevent
multiple inclusion.  The format of the symbol name should be
<PROJECT>_<PATH>_<FILE>_H_.

We do not literally use the path, as the "libraries" part of the path
is redundant.  For modules which are native to the big project (like
shell or spncci), we use

   <PROJECT>_<MODULE>_<FILE>_

For standalone submodules that have their own repository (like
basis or mcutils), we use

   <MODULE>_<FILE>_

Thus, e.g., for spncci/libraries/spncci/unit_tensor.h,

#ifndef SPNCCI_SPNCCI_UNIT_TENSOR_H_
#define SPNCCI_SPNCCI_UNIT_TENSOR_H_
