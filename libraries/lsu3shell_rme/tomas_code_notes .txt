Notes by Anna about SU(3) recoupling  and  RME calculation in SU(3) basis
lsu3shell/bin/

In programs/tomascode/

setenv SU3SHELL_DATA $HOME/projects/lsu3shell/su3shell_data/

OBSELETE
Converts input files from Anna into format used by SU3Recoupler (increasing shell number ordering)
1.  run AnnaConvention2SU3Recoupler
 give file names for  PPNN and PN

	returns output in form used by recoupler 
	—redirect to file 
	

Recoupler expects you want to recouple interactions with 
eta1 eta2 eta3 eta4 rho1=1 lambda1 mu1 2S1  rho2=1 lambda2 mu2 2S2 rho0 lambda0 mu0 2S0
PP NN PN

from source file SU3InteractionRecoupler.cpp

2. RecoupleSU3Interaction inputfile outputfile
		—be careful not to overwrite files 
		— input from step 1
		—output  outputfile.PPNN and outputfile.PN
		— Need to have gls and boost/1.58 loaded

3. Create input file for SU3RME bra_model_space, ket_module_space, su3rme.in
	—first 2 command line args: expects models space for bra then ket (same for both in our case—give twice)
	—third arg: input filename created for SU3RME
		— expects first value is irrelevant hbar omega value (integer) 10
		—second line begins with INT path/file you produced with SU3recoupler
		—enter files name without .PPNN or .PN
		e.g. 
			10
			INT ./operator0000010
		

Output

(ip, in) rho lambda mu 2S || O|| (jp,jn) rho lambda mu 2S    rme: 

ip, in, jp, jn is integer assigned to configuration 

there is a code that lists basis labels for index 
—
ncsmSU3xSU2BasisLSU3
—find out labels are obtained. 
 
arg:: name of model space e.g. 8Be_Nmax0.model_space.txt
—lists all many-body states in basis

[proton config]x[neutron config]

Nex=2  [2 1 1 0]x [1 3 0 0] 
etc

I realized that there is a really easy and quick fix which makes RecoupleSU3Interaction code to carry out recoupling in an k0-independent way. All one has to do is to replace all calls of SU3::k0max( ...) function with the constant equal to 1. I am attaching the three files that I changed. In order to compile the new version, you have to:

1) place RecoupleSU3Interaction.cpp into programs/upstreams/ directory.
2) place SU3InteractionRecoupler.cpp and SU3InteractionRecoupler.h into libraries/SU3ME/ directory.

After recompiling LSU3shell, you should have a new version of RecoupleSU3Interaction that does recoupling in k0-independent way.
