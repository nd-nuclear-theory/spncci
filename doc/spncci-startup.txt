----------------------------------------------------------------

1) You will need to have cloned the following repositories (for
spncci, lsu3shell, and mcscript):

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/nd-nuclear-theory/spncci.git

   git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/lsu3shell/code lsu3shell --branch LSU3develop

   git clone https://github.com/nd-nuclear-theory/mcscript.git

2) For basic installation of these projects, please see the following
instruction files:

  - spncci/config/ndconfig/install.txt: instructions on building
    the spncci project (these are generic instructions which apply to
    several ND Nuclear Theory projects)

  - spncci/config/lsu3shell/lsu3shell-install.txt: instructions on
    building the lsu3shell project (these instructions are oriented
    towards installing lsu3shell for use in conjunction with spncci)

  - mcscript/install.txt: instructions on setting up the mcscript
    scripting system (be sure to work through the examples outlined in
    those instructions before proceeding, since you will need that
    background in order to understand the spncci run scripts)

3) You will need to configure some environment variables for spncci.
Please see the instructions at the start of:

   spncci/script/spncci.py

4) Work through the basic example runs in spncci/script (see the
instructions at the start of each script file):

   spncci/script/rununittensor01.py

   spncci/script/runsu3rme01.py

   spncci/script/runspncci05.py

----------------------------------------------------------------

Tips and tricks:

  - The spncci makefile defines a special target "make base", which
    builds only the production codes, not the test codes.  This is
    faster than "make all".
